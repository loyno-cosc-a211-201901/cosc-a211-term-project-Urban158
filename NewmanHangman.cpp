/*Program Name: Hangman
Purpose: I am hoping to write a c++ program to imitate the classic game called Hangman.
I have been advised that the user will have several different words which may be used for
the game.  I assumme I will eventually learn to draw using c++ and develop a funtion that will
draw a stick figure gallow with a stick figure person attached to. The user is expected to
spell the word before the number of guess attempts draw the full stick figure gallow and person.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
/*
Given the user is expected to spell a word before enough wrong guesses draws a stick figure and gallows,
I am not sure how the word to be spelled will be presented to the user.  Should the user open another file
containing a list of words of which one will be randomly chosen.

Next thing I must learn to do is learn to draw to the stick figure and gallow to be used in the program.
Once I learn how to draw the stick figure, I will have to convert to a loop file where each wrong guess will
draw a portion of the "hangman".

Should I interact with the user after each guess either with a "congratulation, you guessed a correct alphabet" or
"sorry, guess again" and drraw a portion of the "hangman".

I am finally reading and going over the Prof Wolfe and Scott McDermontt's videos for chapter 7 Arrays and Vectors.
Hopefully this chapter will answer some of my questions on how to develop the program.
